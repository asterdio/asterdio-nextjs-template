You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

This project contains all the necessary formatting with prettier and linting in eslint

After cloning the project, 
<ul>
    <li> yarn prepare to setup the necessary linting and formatting on the project </li>
    <li> commit style can be checked from [ commit-style ](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) </li>
    <li> PR titles should also be same as the commit messages, else can cause issue while pulling the changes on it </li>
